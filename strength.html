            <h2>What is Strength Training?</h2>
            <p>Strength training involves exercises designed to improve your strength and endurance by working against resistance. It is a vital component of overall fitness, helping to build muscle mass, boost metabolism, and enhance overall physical performance. Strength training can also improve bone density, reduce the risk of injury, and promote better posture. Whether you are lifting weights, using resistance bands, or doing bodyweight exercises, strength training plays an essential role in achieving a healthy and active lifestyle.</p>

                    <h3>Push-ups</h3>
                    <p>A classic bodyweight exercise that strengthens the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. Push-ups are a versatile exercise that can be modified to suit all fitness levels. They are great for building upper body strength and endurance while also engaging your core muscles. You can try variations like incline push-ups or diamond push-ups to target different muscle groups and add variety to your workout routine.</p>

                    <h3>Squats</h3>
                    <p>Focuses on building leg strength while engaging your core and back. Squats are a fundamental lower-body exercise that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. They also improve balance, mobility, and stability. Squats can be performed with just your body weight or with added resistance like dumbbells or a barbell for increased intensity. This exercise is essential for developing strength and functional movement.</p>

                    <h3>Plank</h3>
                    <p>Enhances core stability and strengthens your shoulders and arms. The plank is an isometric exercise that challenges your entire core, including the abdominal muscles, obliques, and lower back. Holding a plank position requires full-body tension and focus, making it an excellent exercise for improving posture and overall strength. Variations such as side planks or plank-to-push-up transitions can add more dynamic elements to your workout.</p>

                    <h3>Weightlifting</h3>
                    <p>Weightlifting is a strength training exercise that involves lifting weights to build muscle and increase physical strength. Common types include deadlifts, squats, and bench presses, each targeting different muscle groups. This form of exercise not only improves muscle tone but also boosts metabolism, bone density, and overall endurance, making it an essential part of any fitness routine. Beginners should start with lighter weights and focus on proper form to prevent injuries.</p>

                    <h3>Pull Up</h3>
                    <p>Pull-up is an excellent upper-body exercise that targets the back, shoulders, and arms. This compound movement requires pulling your body up to a bar until your chin is above the bar, engaging multiple muscle groups for strength and endurance. It is an effective way to improve grip strength and build upper body muscle mass. Variations like chin-ups or assisted pull-ups can help build strength progressively.</p>

                    <h3>Lunges</h3>
                    <p>Lunges are a powerful lower-body exercise that helps strengthen the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. This unilateral movement improves balance and stability by forcing each leg to work independently. To perform lunges, step forward with one leg and lower your body until both knees are bent at about 90 degrees. Return to standing and repeat with the other leg. Variations include walking lunges, reverse lunges, and weighted lunges for added intensity.</p>
